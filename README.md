# What is Skynet?

Skynet is a decentralized storage and app hosting platform that makes it easy to join the decentralized internet movement, as a user or a web3 developer.

Skynet apps transform whatâ€™s possible on the web. Beyond protecting privacy, decentralization enables application, integration, and innovation that simply cannot be replicated by the centralized world. Now, we can break free of the walled gardens and data silos that have constricted invention and interoperability. Key features of decentralization such as user-owned personal data, persistent identity across apps, and censorship-resistance will be the new standards of the digital world.
